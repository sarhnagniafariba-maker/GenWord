### A Shakespearean Text Generator

This project uses a Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) neural network, built with PyTorch, to generate new text in the style of William Shakespeare.

The model is trained on a corpus of Shakespeare's works, allowing it to learn his unique vocabulary, sentence structure, and literary patterns. By providing a starting seed of words, the model can generate original prose and verse that mimics the voice of the Bard.
